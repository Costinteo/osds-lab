Plans for next year:
- incorporate feedback
- stricter deadlines
- more hints
- change point distribution
- less leniency when copied solutions are clearly not known
- less time spent correcting
- add guidelines and external materials

experimental:
- auto-generating challenges + flags?
- remotely hosted challs?

feedback:
- lab too hard
- maybe add solutions for a simpler exercise just to show off what is expected
this could be good or it could be bad - it cuts off the thinking part of the challenge as you just apply a pattern
